### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I think the topics discussed in the labs helped us get familiar with the syntax of React.js, but I think the lab topics were too late in the week to be useful to the project. In particular, I would have liked an earlier and deeper dive into uisng useState, useEffect, and asynchronous API calls. I think those features of React were the hardest to understand, and I instead turned to React's official tutorials to learn these topics when I realized it was necessary to get the data for this project. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have spent any extra time on this project on the UI styling. I learned Material UI this week in order to create smoother interactive elements (which was something I thought was unpolished on last week's project). Integrating Material UI helped me create more polished elements, but I would have liked to tie together all of the visual elements more cohesively.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I enjoyed presenting my version of Flixster in front of the cohort with Dom, Gabriel, and German. The presentation went smoothly, and I was able to successfully demonstrate all of the features like the movie cards, sorting, sidebars, and responsive resizing. I would like to try more creative movie card animations, similar to Daniel's group where info was overlaid on the poster.

### Open-source libraries used

- [Material UI](https://mui.com/), used for button, input box, and drawer (sidebar) styling

### Shout out

Many thanks to Boris, Gabriel, and German for their help on setting up the API calls and on CSS styling.
